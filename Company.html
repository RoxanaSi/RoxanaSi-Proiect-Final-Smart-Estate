        <p> 'Smart' is becoming the new normal. 
            The word itself has changed slightly in meaning over the past 10 years, as new technologies 
            emerge boasting even more features that help us manage and maintain our lives on a daily basis. 
            Now it's more common to meet someone with a smart phone than not, while watches, TVs, washing machines 
            and lighting systems in our homes are all becoming increasingly connected and attuned to our needs. Now, 
            these real estate trends are taking on a bigger target, and we're starting to see a new modern phenomenon emerge: the smart city.
        </p> 
        <p>
            These future cities will leverage data and technology to make life more comfortable for residents. 
            Frost & Sullivan define the term as “cities built on ‘Smart’ […] solutions and technology that will lead 
            to the adoption of at least five of the eight […] smart parameters”.
            These parameters include smart energy – which we’ve already seen beginning, with heating systems controlled 
            from your phone – as well as smart buildings, transport, healthcare, infrastructure, technology, governance, 
            education and finally, the rather mysterious smart citizen. In terms of real estate trends, the ‘smart buildings’ parameter will have, 
            and is having, the greatest implications and opportunities for the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Connected, smart buildings have the potential to reduce energy use, trigger preventative maintenance, and decrease operating costs. 
            Utilising sensor technologies to track information such as motion, light, temperature and water flow, then automatically analysing the data 
            to detect inefficiencies, and responding in a non-intrusive manner could all become part of how buildings function around us.
